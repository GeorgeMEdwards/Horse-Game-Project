# Horse-Game-Project
This program simulates the game HORSE; a popular basketball shooting game.
It can be played with any number of players. 
One-by-one, each player takes a shot from anywhere they want. 
If they make the shot, the next person must make the same shot.
If they do not, they receive a letter: H, then O, then R,
then S, then E. Once a player receives all 5 letters, they are out of the game.
The game continues until all but one player has all five
letters.
